## Contents

- The Jupyter Notebook file within the `PyCitySchools` folder can be run in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode. I have used both during the assignment.

- The report is included as a PDF within the `PyCitySchools` folder. It can be viewed directly on GitHub without downloading â€” please navigate through the pages to see the full report.

- The `Resources` folder contains the original CSV data files used in the analysis.

## Limitations Mentioned in the Report

- All calculations are present except the total students for the school summary. The total students are only shown in Figure 7 (district summary). This is a limitation of my submission.

- The scores by school size only output results for small schools. Medium and large schools results are not generated due to an error I was unable to resolve, even with AI assistance, so I skipped those steps.
